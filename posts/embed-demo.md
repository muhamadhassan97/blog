# Testing Rich Media Embeds

This post demonstrates the various types of media embeds supported in this blog.

## YouTube Video

Here's a sample YouTube video:

## Code with GitHub Gist

You can embed GitHub Gists for sharing code:

https://gist.github.com/github/0d0de4e06684184ce1c2c2a80b5b3e7e

## Spotify Music

Listen while you read:

https://open.spotify.com/track/3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUc9Lp

## Twitter/X Post

Embed tweets directly:

## Regular Content

Of course, you can still write regular markdown content:

```javascript
// Code blocks work great
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello from my blog!");
}
```

### Lists work too

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

**Bold** and *italic* text, `inline code`, and [links](https://github.com) all work as expected!

> Block quotes look amazing

## Conclusion

Mix and match any combination of text, code, and embeds to create engaging blog posts!
